# DSYS601_Project2
Project 2 files

In this repository are two files - an assessment_code.py Python file and a network_equipment.json file.
Note that python3 and Flask will need to be installed on your Linux VM - the http app will run on TCP port 5050.

You will then write a python script to interrogate your API to :
1. List all equipment.
2. Change Cisco switches with a firmware version of less than or equal to 12.2 to have a firmware version of 15.4
3. Update the API with your changes.

Have fun!
